# ðŸ‘€ useObserver hook

## Description

Project to show how we can integrate the **API Intersection Observer** with React creating a custom hook that allows us to reuse it as many times as we want.

What we will do is take advantage of the API Intersection Observer to load our images in a lazy way as we scroll down. We will integrate this functionality into the hook `useObserver` to use it wherever we need it.

## Hooks used

- `useEffect`
- `useState`
- `useRef`
